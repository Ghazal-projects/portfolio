## About

## About

I'm a PhD student at the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the University of Utah, where I work with [Prof. Robert Ricci](https://www.flux.utah.edu/profile/ricci) as part of the [Flux Research Group](https://www.flux.utah.edu/). My research focuses on cloud computing, serverless systems, and applying machine learning to solve challenges in networking and security.

I'm open to academic collaborations in my research areas. Feel free to reach out through my email!
