**📍**: Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

Salt Lake City is a quiet mountain city surrounded by peaceful scenery and genuinely nice people. You’re only minutes to hours from spectacular landscapes; national parks like [Yellowstone](https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm), lakes such as Mirror Lake and Silver Lake, and many outdoor trails. It’s an ideal place for a PhD student who wants to live close to nature and far from the hustle and bustle of a crowded city!
